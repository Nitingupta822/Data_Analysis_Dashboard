1. Introduction
In the modern food industry, data analytics plays a pivotal role in understanding customer behavior, improving service delivery, and making data-driven decisions. This project explores a Zomato dataset, which contains restaurant-related data such as location, ratings, cuisines, pricing, and online delivery options. By applying various data analytics techniques, this project aims to extract meaningful insights that can benefit restaurant businesses and platforms like Zomato.

2. Objective of the Project
The main objectives of this project are:

To clean and preprocess the dataset.

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Zomato restaurant data.

To uncover patterns and insights related to customer preferences and restaurant performance.

To understand the impact and importance of data analytics in the food tech industry.

3. Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about restaurants listed on Zomato. The key features include:

Restaurant Name

Location and City

Cuisines

Average Cost for Two

Price Range

Online Ordering and Table Booking Options

Aggregate Ratings and Review Counts

Votes and Delivery Status

4. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The following steps were carried out:

Removal of null values and duplicates.

Standardizing categorical variables.

Extracting features like "Country Name" using ID mapping.

Converting numerical columns into appropriate formats.

Removing irrelevant columns such as URL links or redundant identifiers.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helped in visualizing and understanding the data. Some key analyses included:

Restaurant Distribution: Most restaurants are from India, especially in cities like New Delhi and Bangalore.

Online Order Availability: Analysis of how many restaurants offer online ordering.

Table Booking Trends: Comparison between restaurants with and without table booking options.

Cost Distribution: Average cost for two ranges widely, with most being under INR 1,000.

Cuisine Popularity: North Indian and Chinese are the most commonly served cuisines.

Visualizations included bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and count plots to make the analysis more intuitive.

6. Key Insights
Location-Based Insights: Delhi has the highest number of Zomato-listed restaurants.

Customer Preference: Restaurants with online ordering and table booking generally have higher customer engagement.

Cost vs Rating: There is no strong correlation, indicating that expensive doesnâ€™t always mean better-rated.

Cuisine Trends: Multi-cuisine restaurants have a broader appeal.

7. Role of Data Analytics
Data analytics plays a crucial role in:

Customer Segmentation: Understanding user preferences based on cuisines, ratings, and delivery options.

Market Strategy: Assisting restaurants in pricing strategy and service improvement based on customer feedback.

Performance Monitoring: Analyzing ratings and reviews to monitor and improve restaurant performance.

Operational Decisions: Helping Zomato decide where to promote online delivery or expand restaurant partnerships.

Demand Forecasting: Using historical data to predict food trends and high-demand locations.

Data analytics transforms raw restaurant data into actionable business intelligence that benefits both platforms and users.

8. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analytics is a powerful tool in the restaurant and food delivery industry. It provides valuable insights into customer behavior, restaurant performance, and market trends. Leveraging these insights helps businesses make informed decisions, enhance user experience, and stay competitive in a rapidly evolving market.
